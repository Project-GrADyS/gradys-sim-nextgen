# Introduction
The `simulator` module implements an event-based network simulation populated
by nodes whose behaviours are implemented as **protocols**. Use this module to
implement simulations that run in [prototype-mode](../../Getting%20Started/execution.md#prototype-mode),
completely in python, easy to run and setup. The disadvantages of using this
module is that you miss out on the realistic simulation that can be set up using
[integrated-mode](../../Getting%20Started/execution.md#integrated-mode).
