# Quick Setup

Setting up the python part of the simulation framework is easy, just install
the [python package](https://pypi.org/project/GrADySIM/) using the following
command:

```
pip install gradysim
```

With this python package you will be able to create import the project's 
modules from the ```gradysim``` module. With this installation you will be
able to create [protocols][building-our-first-protocol] and run them in
[prototype-mode][prototype-mode].

After setting this up check out the [usage][usage] section to learn about 
how the simulator works.
