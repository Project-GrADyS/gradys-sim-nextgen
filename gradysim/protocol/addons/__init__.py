Add-ons are a way to extend the functionality of the protocol. They don't follow a specific interface so learning how to
use them should be done in a case-by-case basis. Generally they in some way they add new functionality to the protocol
built on top of the primitives available to the protocol. They can be used to simplify the implementation of the
protocol's mobility or communication logic, for example.
